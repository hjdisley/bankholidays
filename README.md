# UK Bank Holidays

## Task

Using React Native, create an application that provides the following two features:

- A landing page that should contain a list of the next 5 unique bank holidays across the UK, within the next 6 months, using the UK Bank Holidays JSON feed (https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json)

- The ability to edit the bank holidays given above. Items should be clickable, navigating to an edit page where each holiday can be edited and saved.

The application should be styled in a user-friendly and mobile-first way. To do this, you are welcome to use any UI library (native-base etc.)

Please also provide some tests using a library of your choosing (preferably jest) to show your TDD skills.

## Screenshots

## Usage

1.  Clone the repo with  `git clone [REPO_URL]`  command
2.  Switch to the project's root directory in terminal
3. Install Expo CLI if it is not already installed on your machine `yarn global add expo-cli`
4.  Install the dependencies by running  `yarn`
5.  Once dependencies have been installed run  `expo start`  to start the expo and react-native server
6.  If it shows a QR code on the terminal as a result of 'expo start' command, then you are good to go!

Ignore the first step on 'Mobile setup' instructions given below if you already have 'Expo' app installed on your phone.

Mobile setup

1.  Install 'Expo' application on your android/iOS device. You can find the links to Android and iOS apps  [here](https://expo.io/tools#client).
2.  Scan the QR code shown on the terminal.
3.  Once the QR code is successfully scanned, it will take few seconds to load and render the app.
